  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.</p>
  <p>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
  interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.

  HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
  enoting structural semantics for text such as headings, p
  aragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML ele
  ents are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
